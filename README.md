This is my simple project I've been working on called Godot. The name Godot comes from Samuel Beckett's play *En attendant Godot* (English: *Waiting For Godot*) because I find myself waiting indefinite periods of time for Godot to play a move.

I made Godot both to practice programming and for a science fair project, but most of all I made Godot to have fun.

A large majority of my code is based off of two sources: Stef Luijten's didactic *Winglet* (which you can find at [here](http://www.sluijten.com/winglet)) and Alberto Ruibal's *Carballo* (whose source is [here](https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo)).

At the moment, Godot currently uses the following techniques:
* Bitboards (including Magic Bitboards)
* Zobrist hashing
* Null-move pruning
* Iterative deepening
* Quiescent searching
* Static exchange evaluation (SEE)
* Alpha-Beta
* Principal variation searching (PVS)
* History heuristics
